Interests:
AI algorithms are nice because they can make things more accurate and precise
Mainly Java and C/C++ for coding software
Physics with Greg Mulder
Maths with Shannon Harbert
Idk what else I guess I just want to get more into coding.

Difficult:
AI algorithms due to complexity
C/C++ with pointers/nodes
C/C++ with memory allocation
Any other types of code I haven't got any experience in
For others sometimes knowing your way around your computer, like shortcuts for things and where thinggs are located, etc.
